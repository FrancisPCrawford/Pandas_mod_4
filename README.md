Week 3 Challenge 


## Summary
   The homework assignment starts with a broad view over the district schools. it calculates scores, budeget, and various other elements. It then dives more deeply into the individual schhols within the district. It asks the same questionns again but with just the individal schools as its scope. it also makes a distinction between charter and district schools. It then starts to compare each school based on its performance. Finaly their is an analysis to see which type of school out perfoms the other.
   
## Analysis
As a whole, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending 645-675 per student actually underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (585 per student).

As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).

As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
